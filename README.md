## About me

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Artificial Intelligence, focusing on Large Language Models and computer vision. I specialize in Python, C++, OpenCV, and TensorFlow, developing innovative solutions in image/video analysis, object detection, and face recognition.

With a strong background in computer science and a Masterâ€™s degree in AI, Iâ€™ve earned certifications in Computer Vision and Deep Learning from Udacity. Previously, I worked as a Digital Solutions Architect at Advistle and a Web Engineer at Logical Creations. Passionate about applying AI to real-world challenges, I am always eager to learn, collaborate, and push the boundaries of the field.
